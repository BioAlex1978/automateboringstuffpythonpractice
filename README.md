# automateboringstuffpythonpractice
Various scripts and examples from "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart, especially examples I've modified in my own ways

All of the scripts here are projects and practice from the book "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, 2nd Edition", available here: 
https://automatetheboringstuff.com/

Some exactly follow the instructions and code examples in the book, some are end-of-chapter projects to practice what you've learned,
and some have optional modifications and additions made by me. Comments in the code usually indicate what the case is. 

None of this is meant to be production quality code; a lot of it is probably not particularly efficient or clean. It's just a repository
mainly to have and share what I've been learning. Cheers! :)
